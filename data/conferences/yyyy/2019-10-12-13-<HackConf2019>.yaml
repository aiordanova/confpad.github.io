    description: I guess many of you are young enough to have never heard of the "Groundhog Day" movie (released way back in 1993), which serves as the inspiration for this talk's title. Without ruining the great movie for you I'll tell you it's about a man whose life is stuck in a loop, and unless he changes something his life is not going anywhere. Does this story remind you of something else? A lot of software projects are also stuck in a loop - starting strong, quickly drowning in complexity, eventually discarded and replaced by projects which ultimately suffer a similar fate. You've seen this happen many times, right? In this talk we'll discuss what exactly is wrong, how did we end up in this mess, and what should change to break that vicious cycle. And maybe we'll have a bit of fun while doing so!

    description: Tech and tech talent are becoming commoditized. This is happening within organizations and within teams. Although tech hiring is still tight, globalization, automation, AI, Cloud, skill shift, and other tectonic movements are changing the tide. What used to be irreplaceable tech and tech talent can now be bought on the open market and substituted for what is already in place. For software engineers, this means our tech skills are increasingly replaceable, which means we are increasingly replaceable. It may be hard to believe when software engineers are in high demand and our wages are skyrocketing, but the writing is on the wall: Software engineers need much more than just tech skills to survive and add real value to today’s teams and organizations. Come find out what skills you should be learning and practising to stand out in the software engineering crowd, be irreplaceable and invaluable to organizations and teams, and succeed in life.

    description: Architecture and solution design can be challenging. In this talk, I will demonstrate how architecting a solution can be as natural as driving a car, implementing similar concerns and logic to your design can make you a better engineer and your services more efficient.Driver license is not required.

    description: Command & Control is still the predominant leadership style in the software industry, except maybe in the most successful super-growth organisations. The talk explores why is there a trend and what we can learn from the successes of existing and past Unicorns when it comes to building and leading a high quality engineering team. I claim leaders should “serve” instead of “command” - act as enabler to all the smart people in their teams and exploit the power of the “subject matter experts” by empowering them with making decisions and owning the delivery. My engineers and managers do not work for me. I work for them - they are the “boss”. That works great for me, for my engineering team and for the organisation. The talk aims at sharing how and why that works, what are the problems that it imposes and how to mitigate or solve them.

    description: In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. “Single purpose” sounds self explanatory and developers usually assume they understand it and move on towards the other principles. In this talk I am going to take them back few steps and explain what stands behind this principle and how to apply it to multiple levels of the application architecture.

    description: The presence and adoption of functional programming concepts in mainstream languages has continuously become more prevalent within the last few years. This leads one to believe, that the things this paradigm has to provide are apparently, in some way, beneficial. Now two questions arise. To what extent is it beneficial and how do these things actually make a difference in my production application? In this talk I’d like to travel across the planes of functional programming and show you how this paradigm helped us, what concepts made a difference and how it may generally, probably, be able to help others.

We have to: - Find all duplicated images - Find them even if they were edited in Photoshop - Find them even if the images are different (from different cameras) but the objects on the photos are the same. What is Image Fingerprinting and how to do Image Fingerprinting with Keypoint Matching? Come at #hackconf this October 11-13 and learn from Vassil Lunchev.

    description: Working with both startups and enterprises, over the years I noticed that many of the companies have challenges setting up strong release practices. That results with risky, error-prone releases followed up with a lot of bugs which cost them a lot of resources. With this talk, I am aiming to inspire people to step back from the day to day operations and think about how setting up a fully automated process is going to benefit the companies they are working with and at the same time get their weekends back. I will talk about optimizing the release process on different levels in the organization, as well as leveling up the quality of the technology. I will also introduce some tools and techniques to the audience that helped us create a steady pipeline. The talk is perfect for tech leads, CTOs, or software engineers who are looking forward to bringing improvement in their organizations.

We will also go through the new features which ECMAScript 2018(ES9) and ECMAScript 2019(ES10) are shipping and what further improvements can be expected in ECMAScript 2020(ES11). We won’t stop at the technical overview but give life to the talk with some practical examples of how the standards differ in real life!

    description: So you built your product, and scaled it to a point where you’re starting to collect a lot of data and outgrowing your relational database. How do you scale your data storage systems to handle the volume and load? During my talk on “Scaling out - from First Principles” at HackConf 2018, this was one of the main follow-up questions, so this talk will cover in more detail a set of different approaches to scaling, depending on the requirements, and from first principles again.

    description: Caching can be your best friend or your worst best-friend. A poor cache implementation can mean the difference between experiencing blazing fast performance or unexplained random slowness, or both!  It can even result in random stale (out of date) content which you can’t explain. In this presentation, we will demo and compare different caching methodologies, and their perceived real-world uses. We will discuss Donut cache, Memory cache, Redis, Varnish, CDNs, and many more. We will dive into demos of real-world implementations which can cause unpredictable problems. Some of these are horrible, and some are face-palm. At the end of this presentation, you will be aware of the different trade-offs with each caching methodology, and which might best for your situation.

Hence, every day we are getting closer to run web apps only on browsers that don’t need to be installed from any app store and it will take control of hardware around us./ In this session, I am going through some of the web capabilities to connect devices into a progressive web app and show how the web could go beyond the browsers and take control of our devices around us.
